===================

Programming assignments for Data Science for Linguistics.

## Assignment 1

**Assigned**: Week 1  
**Due**: Monday, 1/22 before 10pm  

1. Fork this repo
2. Create a personal 'dropbox'
    1. create an empty folder named "lastname\_firstname" (ex. 
    casillas\_joseph). Put it inside ```misc > students```.
    2. create another **README.md** file and place it inside your personal 
    folder. Include the following info:
        - Your name
        - Your email
        - Your personal website if you have one
        - A goal you have for this class
3. Create another folder. Name is ```summaries``` and place it inside your 
personal dropbox folder. Next, read Chapter 1 of R4DS. Create a file called 
**rfds\_ch1\_summary.md** and write a 4 sentence summary about the chapter. 
Save this file in ```summaries``` inside your personal dropbox (the 
lastname\_firstname folder you just made). 
4. Read QML Ch. 1 and 2 (pp. 1-57). Do the R examples included in the text as
you read.
5. Submit a pull-request. It should include the following...
	1. your dropbox folder (lastname\_firstname)
	2. a README.md file
    3. a summaries folder (inside your dropbox)
	4. your R4DS ch. 1 summary (r4ds_ch1_summary.md)

This is how the file structure currently looks:

```
datasci_assignments
                  ├── README.md
                  └── misc
                      ├── links
                      │   └── README.md
                      └── students
                          ├── README.md
                          └── firstname_lastname
                              ├── README.md
                              └── summaries
                                  └── r4ds_ch1_summary.md
```

Take a look inside the ```lastname\_firstname``` folder if you need an example. 
Your personal dropbox should look exactly the same, but with your information, 
summaries, etc. In other words, you will add a folder inside ```students``` 
that looks like this (I am using my name, you will use your name): 

```
casillas_joseph
          ├── README.md
          └── summaries
              └── r4ds_ch1_summary.md
```
